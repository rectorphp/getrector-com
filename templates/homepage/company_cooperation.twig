        <h2 id="intro_analysis">1. Intro Analysis</h2>

        <p>
            At first, we want to make sure we know we can help you. Also, we want to explore the weak spots that would complicate the process. You would not buy a house without checking its foundation, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            We also want to provide you time and work estimates, so you can include them in your budget plan.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">How does the Process look like?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>We sign an NDA, so your code is safe with us</li>
            <li>Then you share your codebase with us, e.g. in a git repository</li>
            <li>We look into the code with various tools, explore weak and strong spots and work out the step by step plan that is tailored to your project</li>
            <li>This analysis <strong>takes 3 weeks</strong></li>
            <li>In the end, we <strong>send you PDF with results</strong> and suggested plan, so you can discuss it with your team</li>
            <li>Then we have a call on how to proceed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">How does the final Intro Analysis look like?</h3>

        <h2 id="hands_on_upgrade">2. Hands on Upgrade</h2>

        <p>
            After we agree on first next steps, we can start immediately the upgrade work. Our team provides <strong>10-30 hours/week of direct help</strong>, depending if you prefer faster or slower pace. We'll dedicate you a developer with Rector experience on legacy projects, who knows how to deal with complex problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            This phase usually <strong>takes 6-12 months</strong>, depending on the upgrade target and code quality of your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            We work in parallel to your team, so we're not blocking the business and <strong>you can keep delivering features as before</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">How does the Upgrade look like?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>We improve code quality to make bigger changes more reliable</li>
            <li>We deliver the smallest PR possible so that you can see changes yourself and merge it immediately</li>
            <li>We make sure the work is always in a finished state in every PR</li>
            <li>We make CI helps us with regressions we meet, so we have a safety net and can move without fear</li>
        </ul>
