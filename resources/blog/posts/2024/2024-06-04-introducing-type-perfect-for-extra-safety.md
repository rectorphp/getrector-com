title: "Introducing Type Perfect for extra Safety"
perex: |
    When dealing with legacy, we first focus on safety by knowing the important types. Code must have reliable type declarations to be refactored safely.

    Over time, we've been adding our custom rules to address PHPStan blind spots first. Today, we're proud to publish them in one solid package.
---

These rules make skipped object types explicit and param types narrow and help you to fill more accurate object type hints. **It's easy to enable, even if your code doesn't pass level 0.**

They're easier to resolve than getting your project to level 1. Their goal is to make your code instantly more solid and reliable. If you care about code quality and type safety, add these 10 rules to your CI.

## Low Hanging Fruit - Exact Instance

There are 2 checks enabled out of the box. The first one makes sure we don't miss a chance to use `instanceof` to make further code know about the exact object type:

```php
$someType = $this->vendorServices->getSomeType();

if (! empty($someType)) {
    // ...
}

if (! isset($someType)) {
    // ...
}

// here we only know, that $this->someType is not empty/null
```

Why it's dangerous? Because we don't know how reliable the `/vendor` class is. It can be strict:

```php
public function getSomeType(): ?SomeType
{
    // ...
}
```

Or it can be loose:

```php
/**
 * @return SomeType|null
 */
public function getSomeType()
{
    // ...

    return 'error message';
}
```

ðŸ™…

â†“


```php
if (! $this->someType instanceof SomeType) {
    return;
}

// here we know $this->someType is exactly SomeType
```

ðŸ˜Š

<br>

The second rule checks we use explicit object methods over magic array access:

```php
$article = new Article();

$id = $article['id'];
// we have no idea, what the type is
```

ðŸ™…

â†“

```php
$id = $article->getId();
// we know the type is int
```

ðŸ˜Š

<br>

### Enable 3 Configured Groups

The following rules can be enabled by configuration in `phpstan.neon`. We take them from the simplest to the most powerful in the same order we apply them to legacy projects.


## 1. Null over False

Enable in `phpstan.neon`:

```yaml
parameters:
    type_coverage:
        null_over_false: true
```

Bool types are typically used for on/off, yes/no responses. But sometimes, the `false` is misused as a *no-result* response, where `null` would be more accurate:

```php
public function getProduct()
{
    if (...) {
        return $product;
    }

    return false;
}
```

ðŸ™…

â†“

We should use `null` instead, as it enabled strict type declaration in the form of `?Product` since PHP 7.1:

```diff
-public function getProduct()
+public function getProduct(): ?Product
 {
     if (...) {
         return $product;
     }

-    return false;
+    return null;
 }
```

ðŸ˜Š

<br>

## 2. No Mixed Caller

Enable in `phpstan.neon`:

```yaml
parameters:
    type_coverage:
        no_mixed: true
```

<br>

This group of rules focuses on PHPStan's blind spot. If we have a property/method call with an unknown type, PHPStan cannot analyze it. It silently ignores it.

```php
private $someType;

public function run()
{
    $this->someType->someMetho(1, 2);
}
```

It doesn't see a typo in the `someMetho` name or that the second parameter must be `string`.

ðŸ™…

â†“


```php
private SomeType $someType;

public function run()
{
    $this->someType->someMethod(1, 'active');
}
```

This group makes sure all property fetches and methods call know the type they're called on.

ðŸ˜Š

<br>

## 3. Narrow Param Types

Last but not least, the narrowed param type declarations, the more reliable the code.

Enable in `phpstan.neon`:

```yaml
parameters:
    type_coverage:
        narrow_param: true
```

<br>

In the case of `private` but also `public` method calls, our project knows the exact types that are passed in it:

```php
// in one file
$product->addPrice(100.52);

// another file
$product->addPrice(52.05);
```

But out of fear and "just to be safe," we keep the `addPrice()` param type empty, `mixed`, or in a docblock.

ðŸ™…

â†“

If, in 100 % of cases, the `float` type is passed, PHPStan knows it can be added and improve further analysis:

```diff
-/**
- * @param float $price
- */
-public function addPrice($price)
+public function addPrice(float $price)
 {
     $this->price = $price;
 }
```

That's where this group comes in. It checks all the passed types and tells us how to narrow the param type declaration.

## Add Type Perfect to your project

First, make sure you have  [`phpstan/extension-installer`](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer#usage) to load the necessary service configs. Then add the [type-perfect package](https://github.com/rectorphp/type-perfect/) to your project:

```bash
composer require rector/type-perfect --dev
```

Run PHPStan to start improving your code. Add sets one by one on the go, fix what you find helpful, and ignore the rest.

<br>

Happy coding!
