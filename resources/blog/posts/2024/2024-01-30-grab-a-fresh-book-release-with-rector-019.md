We've released the [Rector - The Power of Automated Refactoring](https://leanpub.com/rector-the-power-of-automated-refactoring) book with goal of continuous upgrades. It's been a year since last upgrade, so it's our time to setup up and make book 2024 release.

Featuring typical `refactor()` use-cases, enhancing your refactoring skills.

### Simplified Configuration

Introducing a minimalist `RectorConfig::configure()` config for smoother setup.


### Convenient Commands

New commands, such as `setup-ci` and `custom-rule`, to streamline your workflow.

* Dependency Updates: Keeping pace with technology, we've updated dependencies, including Rector (0.15 → 0.19.3), PHP (8.0 → 8.2), ECS (to 12.1), and PHPUnit (9.5 → 10.5).
* Clarification: Added a section on differentiating between `Stmt` and `Expr` in the "Creating Your First Rector Rule" chapter.
