title: "Upgrade Legacy Framework or Change it for Newer"
perex: |
    Would you upgrade your Nokia 3310 to newer Nokia or change it for iPhone with USB-C? Would you upgrade your old Ford Fiesta to newer Ford or change it for Tesla Model 3? Would you upgrade your house wooden windows for better wood or use plastic 3-layers?

    If you use any PHP framework, it doesn't mean you have to stick with it for the end of your project life. The upgrade or change can be both valid options, depending on your project state, PHP community in your country or version.

When we get reached by clients with "we need to upgrade framework X from version 1 to 2", we don't go for the upgrade straight away. Instead, we ask them question about their particular context:

* How fast does framework X help you deliver business value?
* How easily can you hire enough developers with framework X knowledge?
* What is the most used framework by your dev teaIt mightm in their own projects?
* What meetups does your developers go to?

It might sound like we ask technical questions, that have nothing with productivity and business value. After all, the main reason we upgrade is to get fast, deliver value and quickly adapt to beat competition.

## Newer Technology = Faster Learning

Would you rather have 10 developers with Windows 98 or 3 developers with MacBook M3 ?

**Tools, technology and community = productivity.**

Those 3 developers go to IT meetup in your city every month, they share their know-how, their attract other talented developers and can join your team. This talent further improves technical state of your project, make it faster than competition and leaner to future challanges. These devs go to the meetup, share their great experience with your company and attract other talent... and circle continues.

This way you can hire great developers without heavy HR invesments, by supporting your technical stack. We've seen many startups that have been using this approach with success. It was followed by successful exit to a global fund.

## Active Hiring Pool

The goal of upgrade is not to have great codebase now. **The goal is to be competetive in next 3-5 years, prepare for any unexpected changes and provide superior experience for our customers**. That's why they buy products or services from us, that's what keeps company growing.

There is a lack of developers that bring value to your project. This is obvious for any growing company that needs to hire more and more developers. That's why focus on a hiring pool = a group of developers you can hire from. These developers meet your conditions and you meet their payment expectations. Is with fish pool, this pool has to be growing and healthy.

What does this mean in practice? For example, let's say your project use the latest Symfony 7.x. But the applicants around you know well Laravel. Of course you can try to teach them different technology then they use daily and prefer. But most likely they won't be productive. It's more likely your developer count will head to zero, as your hiring pool is dry.

This applies vise versa: if you use the latest Laravel, but all you can hire from are Symfony developers, your project will be unable to grow. **So always consider your specific hiring pool first**.

## Upgrade or Change?

Once we have considered your hiring pool, we can move to the technology itself.

* There is a group we call "dying frameworks". Those are frameworks that very few people would choose to build a new project in 2024.

* The other group is "living frameworks". Most of PHP devs would choose one of them to build new project. Not because they know it for 10+ years, but because they find it easy to use and fast to build desired project. For example, we know Nokia for 25 years, but it would not be the phone to buy as a gift to your friend.

If you're a business owner/CTO and not active part of online/offline PHP community, it can be hard to know which is which. Your company uses the *framework X* since begining, so it's only reasonable to keep using it.

**There is a quick way to guesstimate if framework X belong to "dying" or "living" category**. The download statistics &ndash; if *framework X* is popular, most developers most likely know about it, use it, learn it and improve it.

How to find out downloads stat numbers?

* Go to https://packagist.org/
* Type your framework name to search bar and press Enter
* Click on first package
* Then click on "Installs" in the right column

For example, this year we wrote about [CakePHP migration](/blog/what-to-expect-when-you-plan-to-migrate-away-from-cakephp-2). Let's see its [download stats](https://packagist.org/packages/cakephp/cakephp/stats):

We also wrote about [Phalcon framework](/blog/how-to-upgrace-phalcon-project). What are [the stats in](https://packagist.org/packages/phalcon/cphalcon/stats) there?

Once we have stats for your *framework X*, we need  **a stable reference to compare to**. We use Symfony or Laravel stats. E.g. lets check [Laravel stats](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework/stats):

<img src="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/924196/327701706-b8cd6271-37f4-4647-a3df-565a11adfcf5.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MTQ3MjY4NjcsIm5iZiI6MTcxNDcyNjU2NywicGF0aCI6Ii85MjQxOTYvMzI3NzAxNzA2LWI4Y2Q2MjcxLTM3ZjQtNDY0Ny1hM2RmLTU2NWExMWFkZmNmNS5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwNTAzJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDUwM1QwODU2MDdaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT00ZjYzMGYxMTBlMWYyMTg0ZWQ1Nzc2ZTNkNzU5Mzc0MmRiMWIzODRiNDFmNTRmM2IxYjliMzQ4YmQwZDNmM2JmJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCZhY3Rvcl9pZD0wJmtleV9pZD0wJnJlcG9faWQ9MCJ9.iaoUNWx51OS-JVZOtGEs5p_scKNbJ0azO6Pq1uzgGno" class="img-thumbnail">

Now we have the data to compare. What to look at?

* **absolute daily/monthly downloads** - this will give you idea if your framework is popular or not
* **trending line** - how healthy community is, is framework growing or not; look for past 1-2 years



## Decision Tree

Now that we have data about hiring pool, dying or living framework, last criteria is the age of framework. How old is the version your project uses.

As we wrote in [How to Upgrade Zend Legacy Project](/blog/how-to-upgrade-zend-legacy-project), it's cheaper to completely change from very old framework like Zend 1 to latest Laravel/Symfony. But if your project uses Zend 3, its generly cheaper to stick with it and upgrade.

Here we'll share few practical examples on how to evaluate these data, so you have a better idea if upgrade or change.
