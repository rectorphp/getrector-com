title: "Rector is joining the Open Source Pledge"
perex: |
    Our business is build on open-source and with open-source software. We're using free PHP language, free PHP frameworks and free packages. But those are not free to develope and maintain.

    That's why we're joining [Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com/). To put real numbers on the table and commit to long-term support.
---

We want to support not only existing open-source projects, but also young, fresh and aspiring developers. Those who put more work and effort after paid work. At night, after they take care of their family. On the weekend, when they could rest and relax from hard weekend.

"The people who are crazy enough<br>
to think they can change the world<br>
are the ones who do."

We believe that's how amazing projects are created. By someone with crazy idea to change the world, with little time and money they have, from their tiny room or with with couple like-minded people.


## What is Open Source Pledge?

There is a great write-up of the state of open-source in 2024 by [Scott Chacon from GitButler](https://blog.gitbutler.com/open-source-pledge-2024/). You probably know the company behind open-source and free project we use every day.
 The Private Packagist joined this week, [Nils Adermann sharing their post](https://blog.packagist.com/packagist-is-joining-the-open-source-pledge/).

The idea behind Open Source Pledge is simple:

 * contribute at least 2 000 â‚¬/full time developer/year to open-source projects
 * share the numbers
 * keep on going every year
