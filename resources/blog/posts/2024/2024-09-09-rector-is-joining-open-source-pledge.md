title: "Rector is joining the Open Source Pledge"
perex: |
    Our business is built on open-source and with open-source software. We're using "free" PHP language, "free" PHP frameworks, and "free" packages. But those are not free to develop and maintain.

    That's why we're joining [Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com/). To put actual numbers on the table and commit to long-term support.
---

We want to support not only existing open-source projects but also young, fresh, and aspiring talents. Those who put more work and effort after paid work. At night, after they take care of their family. On the weekend, when they could rest and relax after a challenging week.

"The people who are crazy enough<br>
to think they can change the world<br>
are the ones who do."

We believe that's how amazing projects are created. By someone with a crazy idea to change the world, with little time and money they have, from their tiny room or with a couple of like-minded people.


## What is the Open Source Pledge?

There is an excellent write-up of the state of open-source in 2024 by [Scott Chacon from GitButler](https://blog.gitbutler.com/open-source-pledge-2024/). You probably know the company behind PHP open-source project we use daily. The Private Packagist joined this week, [Nils Adermann sharing their post](https://blog.packagist.com/packagist-is-joining-the-open-source-pledge/).

<br>

The idea behind the Open Source Pledge is simple:

 * contribute at least **2 000 â‚¬/full-time developer**/year to open-source projects
 * **share the numbers**
 * keep on going every year

<br>

In 2023, we've contributed:

* [Symfony](https://symfony.com/sponsor) - 10 000 $
* [junior.guru](https://junior.guru/love/) - 3 530 $
* [phpcsstandards](https://github.com/sponsors/PHPCSStandards) - 1 000 $
* [staabm](https://github.com/sponsors/staabm) - 1 000 $
* [3v4l.org](https://3v4l.org/sponsor) - 250 $
* [gehrisandro](https://github.com/sponsors/gehrisandro) - 200 $

<br>

Total of **15 980 $**
