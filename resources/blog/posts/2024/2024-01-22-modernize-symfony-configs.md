title: "Modernize Symfony Configs"
perex: |
    Symfony configuration is one of the changes that are difficult to spot until they're removed in the next major version. Then you must Google the "invalid option id error message" and hope for a solution. That doesn't sound like an excellent way to spend your weekend, does it?

    Symfony actually adds a deprecation message to those options, but they're not easy to spot.

    Today, we'll show you how to spot them with the help of Rector, PHPStan, and one other fantastic tool.

Symfony security is known for major changes in almost every Symfony version. What worked in the past...

```yaml
# config/security.yml
security:
    enable_authenticator_manager: true
```

...can be changed or removed.

**This actually does not work in Symfony 7**. We want to be warned early, as soon as the change happens, and without running our code.
Other PHP projects use `@deprecation` annotations that highlight deprecated methods, properties, constants, and classes right in code in your favorite IDE.

How about YAML? It does not, so we first have to migrate to PHP.

## 1. Move from YAML to PHP

It is not necessary to bother with a manual flip. Use [symplify/config-transformer](https://github.com/symplify/config-transformer) to automate the process instead:

```bash
composer require simplify/config-transformer --dev
vendor/bin/config-transformer switch-format config/security.yml
```

<br>

It parses YAML, maps it into [PHP format](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-4-php-based-configuration-for-services-and-routes), and prints it out:

```php
# config/security.php
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;

return static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    $containerConfigurator->extension('security', [
        'enable_authenticator_manager' => true,
    ]);
};
```

Job done!

If it's your first PHP fluent config, don't forget to [update Kernel to load PHP files too](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2020/07/27/how-to-switch-from-yaml-xml-configs-to-php-today-with-migrify/).

<br>

Now we have PHP configs, but in reality - it's just another form of array full of strings.

**Symfony can do better, at least since Symfony 5.3**.

<br>

## 2. Move from an array of strings to typed PHP objects

Instead of arrays, we want something we can use in our IDE - **fully typed objects with methods autocomplete**.

Are you on Symfony 5.3+? If not, upgrade first with Rector. Then, you can use [Config Builder Classes](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-5-3-config-builder-classes).

But there is a catch - it's tricky to tell your IDE and PHPStan about them because **they're not part of the Symfony code**. They're generated on the fly based on your current Symfony version.

<br>

To streamline the generating, use `tomasvotruba/symfony-config-generator` tool that detects available extension classes and generates config builder classes for us:

```bash
composer require tomasvotruba/symfony-config-generator --dev
vendor/bin/symfony-config-generator
```

<br>

Check the generate classes in your Symfony cache directory:

```bash
/var/cache/Symfony
```

<br>

We have config builder classes available and PHP with arrays of string.

<br>

### How can we flip those arrays to config builder classes?

Rector to the rescue! Symfony rules for Rector contain one little gem that helps us automate 99 % of work - the `StringExtensionToConfigBuilderRector` rule. Add it to your `rector.php` config:

```php
# rector.php
use Rector\Config\RectorConfig;
use Rector\Symfony\CodeQuality\Rector\Closure\StringExtensionToConfigBuilderRector;

return static function (RectorConfig $rectorConfig): void {
    $rectorConfig->rules([
        StringExtensionToConfigBuilderRector::class,
    ]);
};
```

Then run Rector on the config file:

```bash
vendor/bin/rector p config/security.php
```

<br>

And voilá - here is your state of art Symfony security config:

```php
# config/security.php
use Symfony\Config\SecurityConfig;

return static function (SecurityConfig $securityConfig): void {
    $securityConfig->enableAuthenticatorManager(true);
};
```

*Note: some elements like firewall, roles, etc. will need a separate variable call - PHPStan will navigate you.*

<br>

You have just **increased the value of your configs by order of magnitude**:

* full IDE autocomplete of any security configuration
* no more copy-pasting `"firewall"` string and reading Symfony docs options
* you get warnings by PHPStan if we ever make a typo

<br>

To make PHPStan work and not complain about missing classes located in `/var/cache`, we have to load classes in PHPStan config:

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
parameters:
    bootstrapFiles:
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/SecurityConfig.php
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/Security/ProviderConfig.php
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/Security/AccessControlConfig.php
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/Security/AccessDecisionManagerConfig.php
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/Security/FirewallConfig.php
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/Security/PasswordHasherConfig.php
        - var/cache/Symfony/Config/Security/ProviderConfig.php
```

<br>

## 3. Harvest full power of Static Analysis

We'd love to work with the Symfony project in such a shape, but wait - there is more.

What we really want is to **get early warnings about deprecations right in our CI** before we decide to upgrade. The configs are unavailable in the Symfony Github repository, as they're generated on the fly.

But when we look at the file in our project:

```bash
var/cache/Symfony/Config/SecurityConfig.php
```

<br>

We'll see the `enableAuthenticatorManager()` method is actually deprecated in Symfony 6.4:

```php
    /**
     * @default true
     * @param ParamConfigurator|bool $value
     * @deprecated The "enable_authenticator_manager" option at "security" is deprecated.
     * @return $this
     */
    public function enableAuthenticatorManager($value): static
    {
        // ...
    }
```

<br>

Now we have:

* configs in PHP methods
* PHPStan available
* we use a method with the `@deprecated` marker

<br>

But that's not enough to let CI help us. One piece is missing... care to guess?

<br>

PHPStan provides an extension that reports `@deprecated` elements right in the CI:

```bash
composer require phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules --dev
```

*Note: include phpstan/extension-installer if you don't have it yet:*

```bash
composer require phpstan/extension-installer --dev
```

<br>

Let's run PHPStan on our config to see the result:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan a config/security.php
```

<br>

The PHPStan fails and let us know:

```bash
1/1 [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100%

------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Line   config.php
------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8      Call to deprecated method enableAuthenticatorManager()
        of class Symfony\Config\SecurityConfig:
        The "enable_authenticator_manager" option at "security" is deprecated.
------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Now you're covered and can start fixing deprecations before they're gone completely.

<br>

Setting up can take a while for the first time, but you'll get quickly into it.
The value returns a thousand folds in the long term as you'll get the best Symfony configuration there is.

<br>

Happy coding!
