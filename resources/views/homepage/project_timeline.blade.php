            This page will give you better idea about the steps we'll go trough together. From very first email, to start of hands-on upgrade of your project.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            We focus on speed, quality and proven process.
            <br>
            That's why we can resolve the "paper-work" <u>within a week</u> and then jump right into your code:
        </p>

        <div class="text-bigger">
            <p>
                1. In first email, we suggest a date of an intro call, usually 15-20 mins is enough
            </p>
            <p>
                2. In the intro call, you tell us about you problems, state of your project and your goals
            </p>
            <p>
                3. <strong>We sign an NDA</strong>, so your project is safe with us (got ready-made NDA to save time)
            </p>
            <p>
                4. <strong>You share a Git repository</strong> with us, so we have an idea about project size
            </p>
            <p>
                5. We give you a quote for <a href="hire-team#intro_analysis">intro analysis</a> of your project, that fits within 6 000-8 000 €
            </p>
            <p>
                6. After we confirm, we send you an invoice
            </p>

            <p>
                7. <strong>Upon the payment, we start an intro analysis</strong>
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>The intro analysis takes us <u>2-3 weeks</u> to deliver.</p>

        <br>

        <div class="text-bigger">
            <p>
                8. After we deliver the intro analysis, we'll have a call about next steps
            </p>
            <p>
                9. We start an upgrade work on your project
            </p><p>
                10. Typically 10-15 hours/week, so we can start slow and safe
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>
            This is a rough timeline we follow, as it yield best results and quick adaptation to your specific needs.
