            We begin with a 3-week <a

                analysis</a>, followed by an upgrade work. Usually waiting time is 1-2 months.

        <h3>Can we continue developing new features during the upgrade?</h3>
        <p>
            Absolutely. Our upgrade process runs parallel to your ongoing development, ensuring no
            slowdown in your business growth.

        <h3>Will we need to re-hire your team for future upgrades?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Part of our work is to make your team self-sufficient. We get your code quality the
            highest possible level, get Rector to your CI working for you and then, next upgrade
            will be a matter of days on your own.
