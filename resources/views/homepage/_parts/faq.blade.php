        <h3>We have a dozen of projects. Do you have to make an intro analysis on each of them?</h3>
        <p>
            No. We analyze the largest project first, then guide you in applying changes to others.

        <h3>Will we need to re-hire your team for future upgrades?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Part of our work is to make your team self-sufficient. We get your code quality the
            highest possible level, get Rector to your CI working for you and then, next upgrade
            will be a matter of days on your own.

            Absolutely. Our upgrade process runs parallel to your ongoing development, ensuring no
