title: "How to Migrate Legacy PHP Applications Without Stopping Development of New Features"
perex: |
    Migrating legacy PHP applications is always a challenging task.

    Today I'll introduce one strategy to make these migrations easier by using the power of the Rector. With this strategy, we successfully migrated a legacy PHP application over a period of one year, **without stopping developing new features!**

*This is an introduction post by [rajyan](https://twitter.com/rajyan_k), who used Rector to migrate an extensive PHP application from FuelPHP to Laravel.*

## Difficulty of Migrating Legacy PHP Applications

Migrating requires high knowledge of PHP, a deep understanding of the application, **and time**. Especially in applications running in the production. Migration takes time and man-hours for code modification and testing that the application works after the migration.

While migrating is going on, you have to stop implementing new features. Otherwise, you'll fall into a hell of conflict and outdated branches. Stopping development for a specific time for the migration would be a difficult decision.

## How to Solve it?

Let's see the concept first:

The most important thing is to avoid conflicts.

We have to be careful not to edit the same file in the "Development branch" and the "Migration branch". We continue developing new features as usual in the "Development branch" directory, for example, `old/app`. Then we apply Rector rules to migrate `old/app` and copy the complete result to `new/app` in the "Migration branch", which automated the process in CI.

We are free from conflicts by always editing the app code in the "Development branch" and only adding files in the migration branch. We can also make our "Migration branch" to the "Development branch" by merging them.

You can easily run the new application by changing the namespace in `composer.json` if written in psr-4.

```diff
 "autoload": {
     "psr-4": {
-        "App\\": "old/app"
+        "App\\": "new/app"
     }
 }
```

We gain enough time to test and fix bugs in the new application and keep developing in different branches with this approach.

## Summary

This article introduced one approach that can make migrating legacy PHP applications easier. We used this method and successfully migrated the framework of our extensive legacy PHP application. It can be helpful for other situations such as upgrading PHP versions or refactoring the codebase by Rector.

I'll talk about the whole story of the migration in the next post, so stay tuned!
